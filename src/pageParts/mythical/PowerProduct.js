With an item this hot, we had to act fast, requesting an immediate reorder to keep up with incoming sales for a sold out product. While web sales continued to roll in, White Label MFG worked with planes, trains, and automobiles while pulling a few strings to have this item restocked within only a few days time.  Satisfied fans were none the wiser!

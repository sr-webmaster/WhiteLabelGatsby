            Print on demand ecommerce platforms operate under a pre sale model that requires quick turn  production and direct to consumer fulfillment within 5 days of campaign close.

            Though these programs ensure high volume, exact numbers are not predetermined and require immediate sourcing and production combined with complex diversification requirements in print and garment style.

            A capable partner and cohesive vendor network for this type of business did not exist.

            Independent vendors enticed by volume were incapable of breaking up work loads to facilitate the diversification of designs (individual jobs) being submitted daily.

            Most vendors were incapable of adapting to this style of quick turn production or unwilling to put in the work as they didnâ€™t see the potential for this style of ecommerce to transform the space.
